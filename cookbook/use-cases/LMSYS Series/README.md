# LMSYS Series

LMSYS is THE defining leaderboard to compare raw capabilities of various LLMs. It has so far collected over **1,000,000** human pairwise comparisons to rank LLMs in Elo-scale.

We are creating cookbooks that help you get the best value of of LMSYS leaderboard for **production use cases**, by leveraging Portkey's Gateway, Observability, and Prompt Management features.

## Cookbooks

1. [Comparing the Top 10 LMSYS models using a single function.](./comparing-top10-LMSYS-models-with-Portkey.ipynb)
2. RAG Benchmark Over LMSYS Models (coming soon!)
